Project : Developed and Evaluated Algorithms for Augmented Reality Images.

Developed an image augmentation pipeline to overlay digital posters on angled room wall images. Used
ArUco markers for 3D corner localization, perspective transformation for surface alignment, and seamless
wrapping with masking and bitwise operations. (Course Project).

folder_1: code: Augmented_Reality code.py (This the main source file)
folder_2: Classrooms: source data_1 it used to train model to detect 3d object, from ArUco Marker, finding corner, and then place digital poster.

folder_3: Nirbhay's Room : this folder data generated by me, in order to verify or say evaluate the build model whether its work in any set of environment.
ArUco Marker detected, the poster digitally pasted in the detected area, alignment with masking and prespective transformation also take in consideration.

PDF:
The file with name : Augmented_reality_with_OpenCv.pdf --> this contain whole information about the operation that used in solving this task, the math also physics  behind each techniques is clearly mentioned.
